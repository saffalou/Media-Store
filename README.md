This is a series of SQL challenges that I created using ChatGPT. I wanted something that is flexible and I could control in terms of what I wanted to focus on.

- The script to create the database (MySQL) is in the CreationScripts folder.<br>
- To populate data use the scripts in DataScripts. The data was incremented a few times so you'll see multiple scripts. You can load them all at the start.<br>

- The rest of the files are the queries, effectively an answer to each of the challenges. The challenges themselves are documented in the QueriesToSolve folder.<br>

- This is a project that will evolve as I have time.<br>

**YOU MIGHT WANT TO CREATE YOUR OWN PERSONLISED COURSE**<br>
- If you want to use this database and data you can create your own personalised experience using and LLM<br>
- You'll need to give your LLM (of choice) a copy of the db file and also the data files. This will enable your LLM to get to grips with the context<br>
- From this you should be able ask for specific query type challenges. This approach gives you incredible flexibility in your learning/practice quest.<br>
